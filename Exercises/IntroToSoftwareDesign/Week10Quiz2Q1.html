        <p class="question">For this question, assume we have an array of boolean values called <tt>arr</tt> that has a length of 5.  We want to print out the elements in arr in reverse order. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
for(int i = arr.length; i >= 0; i--)
{
    System.out.println(arr[i]);
}
</pre>
        <p>What is wrong with the above for loop?</p>
        <div class="solution">This would throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The last value in arr is stored at index 4 (one less than length).</div>
        <ul class="choices">
        <li>This would throw an IncompatibleTypeException as we can't iterate through an array of booleans.</li>
        <li>This would cause a Syntax error as we do not use square brackets ([]) to access values in an array.</li>
        <li>The above loop has no problems and would run without issue.</li>
