          <p class="question">Review the scenario below then answer the questions which follow:
          Recall the UML for Lab 2 (depicted below).
          <br>

          <br>
          This UML may represent the partial design for an
          Employee Management System (sometimes referred to as an
          Employee Information System or Human Resources Information System)
          for a business or organization.
          <br>
          Such systems are often used to support tracking and managing of
          employee information and related process.
          <br>
          This may including recruitment and applicant tracking, payroll
          administration, vacation and benefits administration, time and
          attendance management, training, and performance management.
          <br>
          An Employee Management System would need the ability to track
          and manage many different instances of the Employee objects
          (as well as many instances of <tt>Employee</tt> subclasses, such as
          <tt>ExternalContractor</tt>, <tt>PartTimeEmployee</tt>).
          <br>
          <br>
          Which of the following would <strong>NOT</strong> be appropriate
          functional requirements for an Employee Management System?
          </p>
        <div class="solution">Support the tracking and management of a minimum of 100,000 employee records</div>
        <ul class="choices">
        <li>Allow authorized users to add, view, and modify an employee record</li>
        <li>Allow authorized users to search for an employee record</li>
        <li>Allow employee users to submit a vacation\leave application</li>

        </ul>
        <div class="hints">
        <!--   -->
        <p>Remember this question is asking which would not be an appropriate functional requirement</p>
        </div>
