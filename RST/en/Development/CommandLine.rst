Command Line
======================

The command line is a textual interface that allows users to interact with the file system. The file system is made up of files and directories.

The following exercises will teach you basic command line commands while visualizing how the commands affect the file system. In the visualization, the light blue rectangles represent files, and the dark blue rectangles represent directories.

While you enter commands, your location is defined by the directory you are currently working in. This directory is known as your current working directory. Sometimes you need to check which directory is the current working directory. The pwd command exists for this reason.
