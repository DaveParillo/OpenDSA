Welcome to CS2114! 

This module will help you acclimate to the course and course logistics and learn what is expected of you as a CS 2114 student. The course will include a number of different types of assessments.  We also provide a number of drops for a selection of individual assessments. Further specifics can be found within the Course Syllabus.
Note that you will need to complete a number of learning activities each week, these typically include reviewing content modules, and completing section quizzes, Labs, Post Labs, OpenDSA assignments, Programming projects, Tests, and other learning activities. Be sure to monitor the course schedule and plan your time accordingly.

Note the following:

Labs will be due electronically 24 hours after the end of your designated lab time (unless otherwise specified). Be sure to review your registration details and make note of your lab time and location.
Review the syllabus for details of the late submission policy for labs and programming projects. Pay close attention to the due dates for these and all other assessments.
