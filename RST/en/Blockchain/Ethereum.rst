Ethereum
========

Introduction
------------

Ethereum is an open-source public service that utilizes blockchain
technology to enable smart contracts and cryptocurrency trading
without the involvement of a middleman.
Regarded as the second most popular crypto currency after Bitcoin, it
is home to digital money, global payments, and applications.
It is a decentralized blockchain network powered by the Ether token
that enables users to make transactions, earn interest on their
holdings through staking, use and store non fungible tokens (NFTs),
trade cryptocurrencies, play games, and use social media.
It is meant to be more than just a cryptocurrency, providing an
ecosystem for blockchain applications, and a sophisticated Smart
Contracts virtual machine.

Like all cryptocurrencies, Ethereum works on the basis of a blockchain
network.
It hosts a notable amount of functionality for developers building
solutions on Ethereum as a base.
It has a native coin that is known as Ether (ETH), which is used
to pay for activity on the Ethereum blockchain.
The coin also trades on crypto exchanges and fluctuates in value.
The Ethereum ecosystem is written in the Solidity programming
language.
Itâ€™s currently a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain, but is making the
move to proof-of-stake (PoS) with Ethereum 2.0 for scalability
purposes and for a more environmentally friendly approach. 


The Problem to Solve
--------------------

Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency has a major problem.
It is based on Proof of Work as the heart of its consensus algorithm.
This has the unfortunate consequence of causing miners to waste a lot
of electricity simply to add blocks to a blockchain.
This is unnecesary... at least in theory.
The problem is that coming up with a reliable and secure consensus
algorithm for a public, distributed ledger is quite difficult.
Bitcoin was such a revolution for both blockchain technology and
cryptocurrency technology because it was the first proposed solution
to managing a secure public distributed ledger.
Finding alternatives to the Proof of Work consensus algoorithm has
proved to be difficult.

History of Ethereum
-------------------

Vitalik Buterin is considered the creator of Ethereum,
as he published the original Ethereum concept whitepaper.
Buterin presented his concepts at a Bitcoin conference in Florida in
early 2014.
Following his initial work, others joined to help bring the project to
fruition.
His project raised capital through initial coin offering later the
same year, selling millions of dollars worth of ETH coins in exchange
for funds to use for the development of the project.
Ethereum went live officially in July 2015 even though ETH coins were
purchasable the year before.
Buyers had to wait for its launch before they were able
to move or use their ETH.

The first iteration of the Ethereum blockchain was called the
Frontier, and it hosted smart contracts and used a proof of work
consensus algorithm.
This provided opportunities for people to set up
their mining apparatuses and start building on the network.
After the initial launch, Ethereum saw many other updates such as
Byzantium, Constantinople, and the Beacon Chain, where each of the updates
changed certain aspects of the blockchain.
Beacon Chain provided a shift from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake
consensus mechanism.
