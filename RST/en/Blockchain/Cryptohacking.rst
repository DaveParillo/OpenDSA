Crypto Hacking
=============

What is Crypto Hacking?
-----------------------
Crypto hacking is a term for the act of stealing cryptocurrencies.
This can occur by phishing users into fake coin exchanges and
to buy tools that compromise coin exchances. Phishing schemes can occur
over emails, text, or advertisements related to the user's purchases and
wallet. In some cases, these communications trick the user that their
account has already been compromised and the user must provide new information
in order to secure the account again. Crypto hacking also occurs by exploiting 
vulnerabilities within the blockchain or with a user's wallet.

The goal of crypto hacking is to obtain cryptocurrency through those
manipulations listed in the paragraph above. However, as is the case
in most hacking situations, there are white hat hackers and black hat 
hackers. 

White hat hackers use their methods of hacking in order to 
expose vulnerabilities to the company. Companies pay these white hat hackers 
to find the vulnerabilites before a malicious actor can exploit them.
If a white hat hacker obtains cryptocurrency while performing the hacking
practices, they return the coin back to the users.

Black hat hackers are not supported by the company producing the cryptocurrency
or the wallets. These individuals or groups intend to find the vulnerabilities
for their own gains. The actions of crypto hacking further discussed in this
chapter are related to black hat hackers.

Hacking Strategies
------------------

Phishing Attack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Phishing attacks are the methods of stealing data or money from users by using
social engineering methods. This includes asking for credentials or giving a link
to a false log in for accounts. One such example of phishing for cryptocurrency is
called spear phishing. Spear phishing targets individuals with messages designed
specifically for them. The senders of these messages pretend to be trusted sources
and ask for sensitive information or send them to a website filled with malware. In 
the case of cryptocurrency, this type of phishing pretends to originate from the users' wallets.

Another phishing scheme related to cryptocurrency is replacing the address of the 
website in the Domain Name Service, DNS, so when the browser completes the request
for the website's location on a server, the result is a website created by an attacker.
From there, the attacker will gain user information once the user logs in. The user
typically accesses this page from a phishing email as listed in the previous paragraph.


51% Attack
~~~~~~~~~~

A 51% attack can be initiated by an individual, a company, or a group that has their mining
resources collected together as one unit. This actor or black hat hacker has 51% or more of 
the mining power on a cryptocurrencies network. For a proof of work system, this means that 
the actor has the majority of the mining power of computers and network strength. For proof
of stake systems, this means that the investor has a majority of the available coin staked
into the system, increasing the influence they have on the network. Please see :doc:`ProofOfStake`
to find more information about proof of stake and the differences between the consensus algorithms.



Mitigation (Reduce Risk) Strategies
-----------------------------------

Phishing Attacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For protecting against phishing, practice strategies taught by Virginia Tech and 
employers. Such practices include reporting emails thought to be suspicious and do not
open unknown links and do not provide log in information from links given in emails. 
Do not use public Wi-Fi networks to access accounts because you cannot verify if the
traffic is being observed. Use multi-factor authentification to guaruntee the user
is who should be logging into the system. 

In addition, to mitigate the affects for DNS phishing, use a Virtual Private Network
(VPN) to send data on encrypted networks. Also, verifying URLs for trusted certificates
aids in ensuring the website is trustable.
