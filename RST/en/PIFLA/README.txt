Notes about the Spring 2022 eTextbook
(as defined by config/PIFLAS22):

* Using Background/MathProof instead of PIFLA/MathProof, since this
  topic is not central enough to justify the effort of doing the PI
  Frames, and they need some work to be ready.

* There are multiple exercise sets for various topics. Will always use
  Set 1 for this semester.

* Will skip the Minimization exercises (MinimizationEx.rst), since
  they need work to be ready.

* Will skip the Parsing chapter. This is all prose sketch notes
  anyway.
